    <h1>How to Apply Ortho-K Contact Lens (a.k.a. Dreamlens) By Yourself!</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">Back to Home</a>
    <h2>First of all...</h2>
    <p>*This is for Ortho-K lens only! These steps may not be available for normal
        contact lenses. For normal contact lenses, please exit the website.*
    </p>
    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>This process will demonstrate the process of applying Ortho-K contact lenses
        by yourself. If you had trouble putting them on yourself for the first time,
        (which is the problem I went through) you are welcome to follow the procedure
        that I write on this website
    </p>
    <h2>Why would you have to know this?</h2>
    <p>You would have to start practicing applying contact lenses by yourself at night,
        for cases like when you stay late at night but when your parents are sleeping 
        but you want to apply your Ortho-K lens. You wouldn't be able to apply it
        because your parents aren't there to help you! So, you would have to try
        practicing in front of your parents and then gradually become more independent
        as time goes on.
    </p>
    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Courage and Self-Esteem</li>
        <p></p>

    <p>In order to apply the contact lens by yourself, you need to have the courage 
        to do it. You have to be brave for putting the lens on your eye by yourself.
        Self-esteem is also needed to believe in yourself that you wouldn't hurt
        your eye with your lens (it's actually very easy too! It won't hurt your
        eye)

    <h2>Steps and Process</h2>
    <h4>1. Prepare Your Lens</h4>

        Orthokerathology - is it safe?"
    </h6>
    <p>First of all, your task would be to prepare your lens. Pull it out of the
        container, and then drop the water from the lens container by gently shaking
        it off. Put the container on a table, and open the lid.
    </p>
    <h5>1a. What to do if your lens is "on" the lid?</h5>
    <p>Gently replace the lid in the original place (where it should be) with your spoid.
        If possible, do not try to touch the lens with your hand while replacing it.
    </p>
    <h4>2. Grab Contact Lenses with Your Spoid</h4>

    <p>Get your spoid, and squeeze at the holder part. Then, touch the lens and then
        release it. You have successfully grabbed the lens!
    </p>
    <h4>3. Drop your optive contact lenses (1 drop)</h4>

    <h6>Picture from "Optive" (optive.co.za), main page</h6>
    <p>Your Ortho-K lens would have come with an optive contact lens solution. Place one
        drop on the lens on the inner side.
    </p>
    <h4>4. Hold open your eyes with your fingers!</h4>

        Lenses"
    </h6>
    <p>Remember, do not hold it for too long, or your eyes will become dry. Place your
        spoid near your eye where you can apply the lens instantly after you hold open
        your eyes. Open it and look straight. Gently push your spoid in your eye. When it is on
        your eye, squeeze the spoid. Pull the spoid out while you are squeezing the spoid.
        There you have it! Blink numerous times so that the lens will be in the right location and
        reduce irritation in your eyes. Repeat steps 2-4 for your other eye. I recommend
        doing the process for your right eye first!
    </p>
    <h2>How do you know if you are doing this right??</h2>
    <p>After you apply your lens, your eyes will feel uncomfortable. That is perfectly normal.
        If you want to check if your lens is in the right position, you can try to open your
        eyes with your fingers widely and see if it's in the middle. Or, you can try the technique
        I use, which is pulling your lower eyelid down and blinking to see if your lens comes down.
        If your lens comes down, it is a sign that you have applied your lens correctly.
    </p>
    <h2>Practice these steps every day, and then gradually become independent! Thank you
